# Animated active fire map of Africa

In this tutorial, we'll use the Near Real-Time (NRT) active fire data within 3 hours of satellite observation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the satellites distributed from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System. Then I'll show you how to segment the national map of Africa into hex bins and identify which fire points fall within each of them. Finally, we'll create a timelapse map of African fires for the last 10 days.
